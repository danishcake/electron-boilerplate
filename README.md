# Electron boilerplate

This boilerplate provides

- Typescript 4
- Webpack
- React, redux
- Linting and code formatting with eslint/prettier
- Dockerized builds

## Usage from Visual Studio Code

Run the `watch` task by pressing `ctnl-b`, then start debugging by pressing F5.

## Usage from command line

Run `yarn watch` and `yarn start` in two separate terminals.

## TODO

- Some sort of auto upgrade chore thing
- Audit job
- Dockerized build
- Fancy modern CSS library
- A UI framework? Blueprint/react-md?
